              I am a driven, passionate technologist who combines logic and
              discipline with interpersonal skills that power new thinking.
              <br /> <br /> As far back as I can remember, I&apos;ve had a
              fascination with how things work. My natural curiosity has helped
              me learn and discover
              <br />
              <br /> As a team player, I thrive on collaboration, and have an
              innate interest in the world around me â€” especially when
              technology can impact the lives of others.
